This variation helps maintain reader interest and effectively conveys both the setting and the unfolding mystery.\n   - Length variations are present, with shorter sentences often used for emphasis or to convey tension, while longer sentences are used for detailed descriptions.\n\n3. **Description Style:**\n   - **Detailed:** The description style is detailed, painting a vivid picture of the setting and characters. This helps immerse the reader in the story and provides a strong sense of place.\n   - **Concrete:** Descriptions are concrete, focusing on sensory details such as the aroma of fresh bread, the crisp air, and visual elements like the town's streets and the police station's interior.\n\n4. **Dialogue Style:**\n   - **Natural:** The dialogue is natural and reflects the characters' personalities and relationships.
